Nowadays, increasing popularity of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) presents us with new, previously unknown challenges. Those affect mainly in electricity power distribution infrastructure and make utility grid unstable and prone to sharp drops of current energy production. The above circumstances prompt researchers to work on systems which are able to prevent unwanted effects of energy transformation which is focused on developing more RES. One of considered solution for this problem could be an power production forecasting system. An approach to develop such a system is a topic of this research. In this paper an solar insolation forecasting system is proposed. System is designed with usage of Supervised Machine Learning methods. Eleven different regression and interpolation models have been implemented. Performed tests allowed to determine the best regression model, which turned out to be Mean regression.
